/// If AG = DWORD, 2 alignment bytes must be used in order to meet alignment requirements.
/// ELEMENT is BYTE, WORD or DWORD depending upon AG.
/// The data block of the specified length (size) contained in the CMD will be copied into
/// memory, starting at the MTA. The MTA will be post-incremented by the number of data
/// elements.
///
/// If the slave device does not support block transfer mode, all downloaded data are
/// transferred in a single command packet. Therefore the number of data elements
/// parameter in the request has to be in the range [1..MAX_CTO/AG-2]. An
/// ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE will be returned, if the number of data elements is more than
/// MAX_CTO/AG-2.
///
/// After receiving a DOWNLOAD command the XCP slave first has to check whether there are
/// enough resources available in order to cover the complete download request. If the XCP
/// slave does not have enough resources, it has to send ERR_MEMORY_OVERFLOW and does
/// not execute any single download request. If a DOWNLOAD request will be rejected, there
/// have been no changes to the slaveâ€™s memory contents at all.
/// If block transfer mode is supported, the downloaded data are transferred in multiple
/// command packets. For the slave however, there might be limitations concerning the
/// maximum number of consecutive command packets (block size MAX_BS). Therefore the
/// number of data elements (n) can be in the range [1..min(MAX_BS*(MAX_CTO-
/// 2)/AG,255)].
///
/// If AG=1 the master device has to transmit ((n*AG)-1) / (MAX_CTO-2)) additional
/// consecutive DOWNLOAD_NEXT command packets.
///
/// If AG>1 the master device has to transmit ((n*AG)-1) / (MAX_CTO-AG)) additional
/// consecutive DOWNLOAD_NEXT command packets.
///
/// Without any error, the slave device will acknowledge only the last DOWNLOAD_NEXT
/// command packet. The separation time between the command packets and the maximum
/// number of packets are specified in the response for the GET_COMM_MODE_INFO
/// command (MAX_BS, MIN_ST).
