/// If the slave device does not support block transfer mode, all uploaded data are transferred
/// in a single response packet. Therefore the number of data elements parameter in the
/// request has to be in the range [1..MAX_CTO/AG-1]. An ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE will be
/// returned, if the number of data elements is more than MAX_CTO/AG-1.
///
/// If block transfer mode is supported, the uploaded data are transferred in multiple
/// responses on the same request packet. For the master there are no limitations allowed
/// concerning the maximum block size. Therefore the number of data elements (n) can be in
/// the range [1..255]. The slave device will transmit ((n*AG)-1) / (MAX_CTO-AG) +1
/// response packets. The separation time between the response packets is depending on
/// the slave device implementation. Itâ€™s the responsibility of the master device to keep track
/// of all packets and to check for lost packets. It is slave device implementation specific if the
/// data in different response packets are consistent. For instance, this has to be considered,
/// when block upload mode is used to obtain 8 byte floating point objects.
